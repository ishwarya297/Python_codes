# Example usage:
a = [1, 2, 5, 7]
print("For", a, "the least integer not represented is:", least_non_representable_integer(a))

a = [1, 2, 2, 5, 7]
print("For", a, "the least integer not represented is:", least_non_representable_integer(a))



output:

For [1, 2, 5, 7] the least integer not represented is: 4
For [1, 2, 2, 5, 7] the least integer not represented is: 18


write a function that prints the least integer that is not present in a given list and cannot be represented by the summation of the sub-elements of the list.
E.g. For a = [1,2,5,7] the least integer not represented by the list or a slice of the list is 4, and if a = [1,2,2,5,7] then the least non-representable integer is 18.
