class MyClass:
    class_attribute = 10
    
    @classmethod
    def modify_class_attribute(cls, new_value):
        cls.class_attribute = new_value

# Create instances of MyClass
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(obj1.class_attribute)  # Output: 10
print(obj2.class_attribute)  # Output: 10

MyClass.modify_class_attribute(20)  # Modify the class attribute using the class method

print(obj1.class_attribute)  # Output: 20 (change reflected in obj1)
print(obj2.class_attribute)  # Output: 20 (change reflected in obj2)

explanation:

Yes, if you use @classmethod to modify a class attribute, the change will be reflected across all instances of that class throughout the program.

Here's a brief explanation of how @classmethod works in Python:

A @classmethod is a method that is bound to the class rather than an instance of the class.
It receives the class itself as its first argument, conventionally named cls, instead of the instance (self).
@classmethod is often used to modify class attributes or perform operations that involve the class itself rather than individual instances.
When you modify a class attribute within a @classmethod, the change affects all instances of that class. This is because class attributes are shared among all instances of the class.

In this example, after modifying the class_attribute using the modify_class_attribute class method, the change is reflected in both obj1 and obj2. This demonstrates that modifications to class attributes affect all instances of the class.

-----------------------------------------------

class MyClass:
    class_attribute = 10
    
    @staticmethod
    def modify_class_attribute(new_value):
        MyClass.class_attribute = new_value

# Print the initial value of class_attribute
print(MyClass.class_attribute)  # Output: 10

# Call the static method to modify class_attribute
MyClass.modify_class_attribute(20)

# Print the modified value of class_attribute
print(MyClass.class_attribute)  # Output: 20


Yes, you can modify class attributes inside a @staticmethod. However, since static methods do not have access to the instance or the class itself (self or cls), you need to reference the class name directly to modify the class attribute.

Here's an example demonstrating how to modify a class attribute inside a @staticmethod:

In this example, modify_class_attribute() is a static method defined within the MyClass class. It modifies the class_attribute by directly referencing the class name MyClass. After calling the static method, the value of class_attribute is modified to 20.
